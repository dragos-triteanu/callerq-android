    <string name="terms_content" tools:ignore="TypographyOther">By downloading , installing or using this application or any portion of thereof (&#8220;Application&#8221;), you agree to the following terms and conditions.\n\n1. Your relationship with CallerQ\n1.1 Your use of CallerQ&#8217;s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the &#8220;Services&#8221; in this document and excluding any services provided to you by CallerQ under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and CallerQ. &#8220;CallerQ&#8221; means the unincorporated partnership of Adrian Constantin Lupau, Marius Ioan Serban and Sergiu Calin Bologa. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.\n1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with CallerQ, your agreement with CallerQ will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the &#8220;Universal Terms&#8221;. Open source software licenses for CallerQ source code constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Universal Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with CallerQ for the use of CallerQ or specific included components of CallerQ.\n\n2. Accepting the Terms\n2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.\n2.2 You can accept the Terms by:\n(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by CallerQ in the user interface for any Service; or\n(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that CallerQ will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.\n\n3. Language of the Terms\n3.1 Where CallerQ has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with CallerQ.\n3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.\n\n4. Provision of the Services by CallerQ\n4.1 CallerQ is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which CallerQ provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.\n4.2 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that CallerQ may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at CallerQ&#8217;s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform CallerQ when you stop using the Services.\n\n5. Use of the Services by you\n5.1 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the Romania or other relevant countries).\n5.2 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).\n5.3 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with CallerQ, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.\n5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that CallerQ has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which CallerQ may suffer) of any such breach.\n\n6. Privacy and your personal information\n6.1 For information about CallerQ&#8217;s data protection practices, please read CallerQ&#8217;s privacy policy at http://www.callerq.com/privacy. This policy explains how CallerQ treats your personal information, and protects your privacy, when you use the Services.\n6.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with CallerQ&#8217;s privacy policies.\n\n7. Content in the Services\n7.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, personal contact data such as email addresses and phone numbers, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the &#8220;Content.&#8221;\n7.2 CallerQ reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service.\n7.3 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.\n7.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that CallerQ has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which CallerQ may suffer) by doing so.\n\n8. Proprietary rights\n8.1 You acknowledge and agree that CallerQ (or CallerQ&#8217;s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).\n8.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with CallerQ, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of CallerQ&#8217;s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.\n8.3 CallerQ acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with CallerQ, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that CallerQ has no obligation to do so on your behalf.\n8.4 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.\n8.5 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by CallerQ, you agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trademark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.\n\n9. License from CallerQ\n9.1 CallerQ gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by CallerQ as part of the Services as provided to you by CallerQ (referred to as the &#8220;Software&#8221; below). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by CallerQ, in the manner permitted by the Terms.\n9.2 Subject to section 1.2, you may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by CallerQ, in writing.\n9.3 Subject to section 1.2, unless CallerQ has given you specific written permission to do so, you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software.\n\n10. Content license from you\n10.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services.\n\n11. Software updates\n11.1 The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from time to time from CallerQ. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit CallerQ to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Services.\n\n12. Ending your relationship with CallerQ\n12.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or CallerQ as set out below.\n12.2 CallerQ may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:\n(A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or\n(B) CallerQ is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or\n(C) the partner with whom CallerQ offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with CallerQ or ceased to offer the Services to you; or\n(D) CallerQ is transitioning to no longer providing the Services to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service; or\n(E) the provision of the Services to you by CallerQ is, in CallerQ&#8217;s opinion, no longer commercially viable.\n12.3 Nothing in this Section shall affect CallerQ&#8217;s rights regarding provision of Services under Section 4 of the Terms.\n12.4 When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and CallerQ have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 19.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.\n\n13. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES\n13.1 NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 13 AND 14, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT CALLERQ&#8217;S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE LIMITATIONS WHICH ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n13.2 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &#8220;AS AVAILABLE.&#8221;\n13.3 IN PARTICULAR, CALLERQ, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT:\n(A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,\n(B) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR,\n(C) ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, AND\n(D) THAT DEFECTS IN THE OPERATION OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.\n13.4 ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.\n13.5 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM CALLERQ OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.\n13.6 CALLERQ FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\n14.

THIS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF PROFIT (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS;\n(B) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OR DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF:\n(I) ANY CHANGES WHICH CALLERQ MAKE TO THE SERVICES, OR FOR ANY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY CESSATION IN THE PROVISION OF THE SERVICES (OR ANY FEATURES WITHIN THE SERVICES);\n(II) THE DELETION OF, CORRUPTION OF, OR FAILURE TO STORE, ANY CONTENT AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS DATA MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED BY OR THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES;\n(III) YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE CALLERQ WITH ACCURATE ACCOUNT INFORMATION;\n(IV) YOUR FAILURE TO KEEP YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT DETAILS SECURE AND CONFIDENTIAL;\n14.2 THE LIMITATIONS ON CALLERQ&#8217;S LIABILITY TO YOU IN PARAGRAPH 14.1 ABOVE SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT CALLERQ HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.\n\n15. Other content\n15.1 The Services may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content or resources. CallerQ may have no control over any websites or resources which are provided by companies or persons other than CallerQ.\n15.2 You acknowledge and agree that CallerQ is not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from such websites or resources.\n15.3 You acknowledge and agree that CallerQ is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such websites or resources.\n\n16. Changes to the Terms\n16.1 CallerQ may make changes to the Universal Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, CallerQ will make a new copy of the Universal Terms available at http://www.callerq.com/tos.\n16.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Universal Terms have changed, CallerQ will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Universal Terms.\n\n17. General legal terms\n17.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or in connection with your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.\n17.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and CallerQ and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which CallerQ may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and CallerQ in relation to the Services.\n17.3 You agree that CallerQ may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.\n17.4 You agree that if CallerQ does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which CallerQ has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of CallerQ&#8217;s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to CallerQ.\n17.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.\n17.6 The Terms, and your relationship with CallerQ under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the Romania without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and CallerQ agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Cluj, to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that CallerQ shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</string>
